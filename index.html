    Patients on artificial ventilation need the air they breathe to be artificially humidified to prevent airway damage. The RespirAq active humidifier is a heated humidifier complete with an integrated filter that humidifies without the need for additional water.  
    Within 100 milliseconds, the humidifier can switch between a super-hydrophilic state to capture moisture during expiration, and a super-hydrophobic state which returns the moisture during inspiration. The device has been designed to deliver 37°C fully humidified (95% relative humidity) respiratory gases for invasively mechanically ventilated patients.</p>

          As a high-performance humidification device, the RespirAq active humidifier achieves 35-40 mgH<sub>2</sub>O/L. The RespirAq has a minimal 14 ml of internal dead volume ensuring unimpeded CO<sub>2</sub> clearance rates. With a pressure drop of 0.2 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at 30 lpm, 0.5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at 60 lpm and 1 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at 90 lpm, The RespirAq active humidifier has a negligible effort to patient work of breathing. The RespirAq is a light weight 30g reducing the risk of pressure injury.
